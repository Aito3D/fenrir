# Baseline Changelog

User-approved behavior changes made during the refactor campaign, each an
explicit exception to the campaign's zero-functionality-change rule.

## T-012 — 2026-08-11 — user-approved behavior change

`useProjectPatchMutation`'s three consumers (`ProjectDetailPanel`'s description
save, its social save, and `ShippingCard`'s shipping save) computed
`expected_version` by re-reading the shared `['aito-projects']` board cache at
save time — a cache another operator's concurrent edit rewrites via the
`aito_changed` WS handler while the first operator's editor is still open, so
the version guard could never fire across operators. Fixed by capturing
`project.version` once when each edit session opens and sending that as
`expected_version`, with the shared board cache kept only as the fallback for
one-shot actions (retry-sync, description regenerate, remove shipment) that
never open an editor session. Observable change, quoting the approved
description verbatim: "A save that currently succeeds silently after another
operator's edit arrived will instead return 409 and show the version-conflict
toast with the editor reopened on the user's typed text."

## T-009 — 2026-08-11 — user-approved behavior change

`POST /aito/` accepted a client-supplied `quote_status` as free text with no
coupling to `quote_id`, letting a principal holding only `aito:create` write
`quote_status="accepted"`/`"declined"` directly onto a brand-new card —
bypassing the dedicated `/quote-status` route's `aito:update` permission, its
409 terminal-transition guards, and its `quote.{status}` timeline event, and
landing the card straight on a work column (or Done, for a decline) with no
recorded actor. `AitoProjectCreate.quote_status` is now restricted to the
Zoho vocabulary (`Literal["draft","sent","viewed","accepted","declined","expired"]`)
and a decided status (`accepted`/`declined`) is only accepted alongside a
`quote_id` — i.e. a genuine import of an already-decided Books quote, which
now also records a `quote.{status}` event with an actor. Observable change,
quoting the approved description verbatim: "POST /aito/ with quote_status
'accepted' or 'declined' but no quote_id would start returning 422 instead of
creating a card that lands directly on a work column; any API client doing
that must set the status afterwards via POST /aito/{id}/quote-status."

### T-012 addendum — 2026-08-11 — clarification only, NO code change
The blind verifier observed that T-012's protection covers the FIRST save of an edit session:
`ProjectDetailPanel` clears the captured version in `onError` for every failure, so after the
conflict toast a retry falls back to the cache read and can overwrite the peer's edit. That was
also the behavior before T-012, so it is not a regression — T-012 strictly added a 409 where there
was silent loss.

The user was asked and chose to LEAVE this as-is: after the 409 the operator has been told a
conflict exists and their typed text was preserved, so an explicit retry is a deliberate, informed
overwrite, and keeping that path avoids a state where the operator cannot save at all (there is no
UI to view or merge the peer's text). Surfacing the peer's text on conflict was considered and
deliberately deferred as feature work, out of scope for a zero-behavior-change campaign.

This entry documents that decision. It is accompanied by NO code change, and asserts no behavior
beyond what the T-012 entry above already describes and the iteration-1 verifier already verified.

## T-020 — 2026-08-11 — narrows an unapproved behavior change back to baseline

T-009 (above) closed `AitoProjectCreate.quote_status` to a six-value `Literal` vocabulary. The user
approved exactly one observable change for T-009 — a decided status (`accepted`/`declined`) without
a `quote_id` now returns 422 — but the implementation ALSO made a blank or out-of-vocabulary status
422 the whole request, which was never approved. That was reachable: `aito_quote_import.py`'s
`build_preview` emits `estimate.get("status") or ""` for a Books estimate with no status, and
`useAitoPageMutations.ts` forwards it verbatim as `quote_status` on import, so a status-less or
unrecognised-status (e.g. `invoiced`) Books estimate would fail the entire import with a generic
error toast, where before T-009 the card was created.

Fixed by adding a `field_validator(mode="before")` on `AitoProjectCreate.quote_status` that degrades
any string outside the six known values (including `""`) to `None`, before the `Literal` check runs
— mirroring this schema file's existing `client_phone` precedent
(`aito_quote_import._client_snapshot`, which degrades an unparseable Zoho contact phone to `None`
rather than failing the import over a field the user cannot fix from the import modal). Because the
coercion runs before validation, the field's declared type is unchanged
(`Literal["draft","sent","viewed","accepted","declined","expired"] | None`), so the OpenAPI/JSON
schema is unaffected — confirmed by `tools/snapshot.py verify` (9/9 probes match, including
`aito-pydantic-schemas`, with no re-record needed).

The approved T-009 gate is untouched and still enforced: `accepted`/`declined` without a `quote_id`
still returns 422 (`_decided_status_needs_a_quote_id`, unchanged), and a decided status arriving WITH
a `quote_id` still succeeds and still records the `quote.{status}` timeline event with an actor. This
is not itself a new user-visible behavior change beyond what T-009 already introduced — it narrows
T-009's unapproved side effect back toward the pre-campaign baseline (a blank/unrecognised status no
longer blocks an otherwise-valid import), so it needs no separate approval.

## T-013 — 2026-08-11 — user-approved behavior change

`POST /aito/{project_id}/quote-email` (`send_quote_email`) called `zoho_service.email_estimate(...)`
— which really emails the client — and only then wrote `record('quote.emailed')`, `_summary_for`,
`adopt_quote_status`, `_apply_rules`, and `record('quote.sent')`, all landing in a single
`await db.commit()` at the very end. This app runs one SQLite file that the `aito_quote_sync` worker
also commits through, so an `OperationalError: database is locked` on that commit (or on any of those
writes' own flush) was a realistic outcome. When it happened the handler raised, `get_db` rolled the
whole session back, and the request 500'd — but the client had already received the email. Nothing
local survived: no `quote.emailed` event, `quote_status` unchanged, card still in the Quote column.
The frontend's `useSendQuoteMutation` then treated the 500 as "nothing was written, safe to retry",
so one more click sent the client a second real quote email, with the first send absent from the
audit timeline.

Fixed by committing the `quote.emailed` event on its own, immediately after `email_estimate` returns
and before the status-adoption / `_apply_rules` work. That commit is now durable regardless of what
happens next. The card-move half (`adopt_quote_status`, `project.quote_status_block`/`_remote`
clearing, `_apply_rules`, `record('quote.sent')`, the second commit) is wrapped in its own
try/except: on failure it rolls back just that half, logs a warning, and the handler returns 200 with
the already-existing `marked_sent=False` (no schema change — `AitoQuoteEmailResponse.marked_sent`
already existed for the "card wasn't in the Quote column" case; a card-move failure now degrades into
that same field rather than a 500). This also required reordering the trailing `_broadcast_changed` /
`db.refresh(project)` calls: `Session.rollback()` expires every attribute on `project` regardless of
`expire_on_commit`, so `db.refresh(project)` now runs before anything reads `project.id` again.

Observable change, quoting the approved description verbatim: "A send whose local bookkeeping fails
will leave a `quote.emailed` row on the timeline (and may return 200 with marked_sent=false) instead
of appearing to have never happened."

Confirmed via a new regression test
(`test_a_failed_card_move_still_records_the_send` in `backend/tests/unit/test_aito_quote_email.py`)
that patches `_apply_rules` to raise `OperationalError("database is locked")` after a successful
`email_estimate`: pre-fix this 500'd and left no `quote.emailed` event; post-fix it returns 200 with
`marked_sent=False`, the card stays in `devis`, and `quote.emailed` (but not `quote.sent`) is on the
timeline. `tools/snapshot.py verify` shows only `aito-openapi` moving, confined to the
`send_quote_email` docstring text (now documenting this behavior) that FastAPI surfaces as the
route's OpenAPI `description` — no field, schema, or route-shape change; re-recorded and re-verified
9/9. `SURFACE.md` is unchanged (route list identical).
